## Software

To work through this tutorial you will need access to a spreadsheet program. For this you have many options: [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel),  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [Apple Numbers](https://support.apple.com/numbers), [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/), [Onlyoffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), [WPS office](https://www.wps.com/), among others. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but
the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, we encourage you to use LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel, as the tasks we will
be doing have been tested in these programs. If you don't have Microsoft Excel, you can use
LibreOffice. It's a free, open source spreadsheet program. Here are the instructions to install it:
